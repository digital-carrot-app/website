title: Track Steps on your Phone
---

If you don't own a fitness tracker, you can track simple fitness metrics such as steps
directly with your phone.

## iPhone

Apple Health should enable step counting by default. If you don't see steps showing up in Digital Carrot, open up the Apple health app
and double check to see if your steps are updating. If steps are showing up in Apple Health, but not Digital Carrot, double check
that Digital Carrot has permission to read health data from Apple Health

## Android

The [Google Fit app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.fitness&hl=en) can track steps
without a fitness tracker. Simply download it, and set it up to share data with Google Health Connect.
