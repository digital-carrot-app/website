## Known issues with Location Tracking

The following issues are known to occur when background location access is disabled:

- Goals that require you to spent a minimum amount of time in an area won't trigger unless you open up the app upon entering a tracked area.
- Entering a tracked area, closing the app and leaving the tracked area will cause the app to count all of the time between leaving the area and opening the app again as time you spent in the tracked area (thus enabling cheating).
